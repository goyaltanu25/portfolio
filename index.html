        <h1>Hey Buddy,Let me start with who am I.</h1>
        <p>
          I am Tanu Goyal and I am learning Full Stack Development with Tanay
          sir, I am 24 years old, living in Delhi. As I will be sharing a lot
          with you about my techstack and all, Let me here tell you what else I
          like. So basically I enjoy listening TED talks a lot, I have keen
          interest in becoming a better human being, I am developing interest in
          planting, reading and I like writing. Apart from these I like dancing
          and chanting devotional songs Well, I think we are friends now :P :).

        <h1>Working in Accenture</h1>
        <p>
          I am a so called working professional, I have previously worked in IBM
          for 2 years, and so far I have done things like monitoring batch jobs
          day and nights, triggering them and taking care of the jobs worked
          fine or not, if there comes an issue, resolved it. Honestly so far I
          feel like a fresher as there is a lot to learn and I have just started
          with it. With the help of my current org. which is Accenture, I got to
          learn React, I know basics, In my last two years while monitoring
          batch jobs, I have learned and done some basic POCs in Angular, So my
          current status is that I feel like a beginner in web development, So
          if you're also the one and want to learn web development, follow along
          with Tanay Sir.

        <p>
          My bucket list for next 6 months I am following along with Tanay sir,
          for improving on my skills, I recently get to know about him, Now
          currently after office hours I am trying to focus on following 532, So
          Hopefully I will get there or atleast would raise my learning graph
          and be a better version of myself.
