        <h1>Working in Accenture</h1>
        <p>
          I am a working professional, currently working in Accenture, I have previously worked in IBM
          for 2 years, and I have worked on Angular extensively there. However I
          still feel there is a lot to learn. I have got expertise in Angular, Javascript, 
          HTMl5, CSS3, SCSS, React and other Front End Technologies. I am an independent Developer 
          who really enjoy coding and feel responsible about my code and work.

          <h1>My Experiences</h1>
          <p>These are a few snapshots of my growing career and there is a lot to add here.
            One is my personal favourite which belongs to my heart, that is my blog Icanfeelaround, 
            whenever I feel a little low in life sometimes I go through my blogs, sometimes when I feel
            something is worth noting and a lesson for lifetime, I write about it on my blog. So Do Visit, its a nice
            place.
            Another one is my github profile where I have kept my code and my learning journey.
